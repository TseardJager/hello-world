# hello-world
My first one
Well this is my starting point at Github.
For a while I'm now into Arduino projects and still learninig every day.
Mostly interested in weather applications and now busy with the AS3935 lightning sensor as an addition to my station.
Already made the luftdaten particle sensor based on the ESP8266 board with the SDS011 particle sensor works very nice.
Eager to learn  more!!!
